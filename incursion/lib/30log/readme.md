The code is from https://github.com/Yonaba/30log

The file `class.ttslua` is a copy of [`30log-clean.lua`](https://github.com/Yonaba/30log/blob/master/30log-clean.lua) at commit [04eff73a3160235e7e527edda68ac46e979d6798](https://github.com/Yonaba/30log/commit/04eff73a3160235e7e527edda68ac46e979d6798).

The file is renamed to `class` so it is more intuitive/readable, and the extension is changed to `ttslua` so the Tabletop Simulator Atom plugin will apply syntax highlighting.
